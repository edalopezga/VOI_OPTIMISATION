# VOI_OPTIMISATION
This algorithm automatizes the process to assign artificial leaks, estimate probabilities, obtain objective function values and perform the optimization problem for the deployment of pressure sensors.
The code is part of the paper: "Methodology to Optimally Place Pressure Sensors for Leak Detection in Water Distribution Systems Using Value of Information" and was partly funded by the European Commission via the NAIADES project, grant agreement 820985. 
The data of WDN model analyzed in this paper, the simulation results, and the code-file generated to solve the optimization problem are available from the corresponding author by request.
